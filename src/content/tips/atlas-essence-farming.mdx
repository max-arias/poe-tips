## Why Essence Farming?

Essences are one of the most **consistent** strategies because:

1. **Steady demand** - Crafters always need essences
2. **Low barrier** - No special gear or builds required
3. **Simple farming** - Just clear maps and click crystals
4. **Compounds well** - More atlas passives = exponentially more essences

## Required Atlas Passives

### Core Nodes (Must Have)
- **Crystal Resonance** - Essences have % chance to have 1 additional essence
- **Crystal Lattice** - Additional essence monsters in maps
- **Amplified Energies** - Essences are 1 tier higher

### Valuable Additions
- **Essence nodes leading to Delirium** cluster for double-dipping if you run Deli
- **Map sustain nodes** if you're struggling with map drops

## The Strategy

### Early League (Day 1-3)
1. Focus on unlocking Voidstones and getting map sustain
2. Pick up essence passives as you path through the tree
3. Consolidate essences to sell in bulk

### Mid League
1. Full essence cluster specced
2. Use Essence Scarabs (Gilded or Winged)
3. Bulk sell every 50-100 maps

## What to Keep vs Sell

### Always Sell (Bulk)
- Shrieking/Deafening tier essences
- Corrupted essences add premium

### Consider Using
- Deafening Greed (flat life on belts)
- Deafening Zeal (attack speed)
- Deafening Contempt (flat phys weapons)

## Map Choice

Any maps work, but prefer:
- **Open layouts** for fast clear
- **T16** for best essence tiers
- **No boss-focused maps** - you're here for essence density
