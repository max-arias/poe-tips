## How It Works

Selling a **full set** of Rare (yellow) items to any NPC vendor will reward you with Chaos Orbs. To maximize profit, items should be kept **unidentified**.

## The Full Set Requirements

To complete the recipe, you must sell one of each of the following in a single transaction:

* **Helmet** (1)
* **Body Armour** (1)
* **Gloves** (1)
* **Boots** (1)
* **Belt** (1)
* **Amulet** (1)
* **Rings** (2)
* **Weapon** (One 2-Handed weapon **OR** two 1-Handed weapons)

## Important Rules

1.  **Item Level:** All items must be **Item Level 60 to 74**. If any item is below iLvl 60, you will receive a Chance Orb. If all items are iLvl 75+, you will receive a Regal Orb.
2.  **Unidentified Bonus:** If the entire set is **unidentified**, the vendor gives you **2 Chaos Orbs**. If even one item is identified, you only receive **1 Chaos Orb**.

## Strategic Tips

* **The Bottleneck:** Rings, Amulets, and Belts drop much less frequently than armor. Only pick up enough armor/weapons to match your jewelry count to save stash space.
* **The "One High Level" Trick:** If you have mostly iLvl 75+ items (Regal recipe), you can include **just one** item between iLvl 60-74 to force the vendor to give you Chaos Orbs instead.
* **Ignore Bases:** Don't worry about the stats or the base type of the items. Since you aren't identifying them, a "bad" base is worth exactly the same as a "good" base.

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Use a dedicated "dump tab" for your recipe items. Collect jewelry in one corner and armor/weapons in the rest. Once you have two rings and an amulet, grab the rest of the set and sell it all at once to minimize time spent at the vendor.
