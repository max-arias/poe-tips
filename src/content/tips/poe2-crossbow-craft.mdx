## Overview

This crafting method focuses on scaling **Physical Damage** and **Skill Levels** on weapons like Crossbows. By utilizing **Omens of Dextral Crystallization**, you can deterministically swap unwanted suffixes for powerful, high-tier modifiers that are otherwise difficult to hit.

## Preparation

- **Base:** Start with a magic weapon that has a high **% Increased Physical Damage** roll.
- **Core Currency:** - **Greater Essence of Abrasion** (for Flat Physical damage).
    - **Omens of Dextral Crystallization** (the primary tool for swapping mods).
    - **Exalted Orbs** and **Greater Exalted Orbs**.

## Step-by-Step Crafting

### 1. Establishing the Prefixes
Use a **Greater Essence of Abrasion** on your magic base. This upgrades the item to Rare and adds a high tier of **Flat Physical Damage**. You should now have two strong physical prefixes and one random suffix.

### 2. The Third Prefix (Elemental Scaling)
Use an **Omen of Dextral Crystallization**. This will remove the existing suffix and add a specific powerful prefix.
- For a lightning build, aim for **Gain % of Physical Damage as Extra Lightning Damage**.

### 3. Guaranteeing Skill Levels
With your three prefixes locked, you need to fix the suffixes:
1. **Exalt Slam:** Use a standard **Exalted Orb** to add a random suffix.
2. **Crystallize:** Use another **Omen of Dextral Crystallization**. This removes the random suffix and adds **+5 to Level of [Weapon] Skills**.

### 4. Filling the Suffixes and Hunting Onslaught
1. Use **Greater Exalted Orbs** to fill the remaining suffix slots.
2. To push the item further, use a final **Omen of Dextral Crystallization** to try and roll **Onslaught**. 
    - **Warning:** This has a 2/3 chance to remove one of the "junk" suffixes and a 1/3 chance to remove your +5 Skill Level mod. If you lose the skills, you must repeat Step 3.

## Final Touches

- **Runes:** Apply **Iron Runes** to the final product to further scale the base **Physical Damage**, which in turn scales your "Extra Damage as Lightning" modifiers.
- **Quality:** Ensure the weapon is at maximum quality to maximize the physical damage scaling.

> 💡 **Pro tip:** If you are crafting for an off-hand or specific niche builds, consider using **Abyss Desecration** (via **Omen of Abyssal Echoes**) before finishing your suffixes to hunt for mods like **+1 Maximum Totems**.
