## Overview

This method leverages the **Homogenizing Omen** mechanic in Path of Exile 2 to force the game into rolling specific tags. By isolating the **Life** and **Minion** tags, you can deterministically hit +3 or +4 Level of Minion Skills on a scepter.

## Preparation

- **Base:** **Rattling Scepter** (the preferred base for most minion builds). [00:02:38]
- **Item Level:** Must be **iLvl 78** or higher to roll the +4 tier. [00:02:49]
- **Mechanic:** The **Homogenizing Omen** ensures that an Exalted Orb adds a modifier sharing a tag family with an existing mod on the item. [00:03:15]

## Step-by-Step Crafting

### 1. Setup the Tags
You need a scepter with specific "seed" modifiers. The easiest way is via Recombination. [00:04:46]
- **Modifier A:** **Allies in your presence regenerate life** (contains the **Life** tag).
- **Modifier B:** **Spirit** (this mod has no tag, so it doesn't interfere with the Omen). [00:04:19]

### 2. Force the Minion Tag
Use a **Homogenizing Omen** and then an **Exalted Orb**. 
- Because the item has a **Life** tag (from the regen mod), the Omen forces another Life-tagged mod.
- On a scepter, this will guarantee **% Increased Minion Life**. [00:05:13]

### 3. The Guaranteed +4 Roll
Now your item has both **Life** and **Minion** tags.
- Use another **Homogenizing Omen** paired with a **Greater Exalted Orb**. [00:06:01]
- The only remaining modifier on a scepter that shares the **Life** or **Minion** tags is **+X to Level of Minion Skills**. [00:05:47]
- **Greater Exalted Orbs** have a minimum modifier level (30-35), which prevents the low +1 and +2 tiers from rolling, leaving you with a guaranteed **+3** or **+4**. [00:06:13]

## Advanced: Fracturing with Desecration

If you want to fracture the +4 Minion Skills to craft a "mirror-tier" item, you can improve your odds:
1. **Desecrate** the item to add a hidden "veiled" modifier. [00:08:41]
2. **Do not unveil it.** A veiled mod counts as a modifier but cannot be targeted by a **Fracturing Orb**. [00:09:13]
3. This turns a 1-in-4 gamble into a **1-in-3 chance** to hit your desired fracture. [00:09:20]

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Use a **Greater Exalted Orb** instead of a Perfect one for the final step. It is much cheaper and still bypasses the low-tier +1/+2 level rolls, making the craft very cost-effective. [00:06:01]
