## The 3-Step Method

This strategy works for most items but is particularly effective for **Talismans** and **Armor** in the early-to-mid endgame.

### Step 1: Secure the Base
Search the market for a **Magic Base** with a high-tier primary stat.
- **Weapons:** High **% Increased Physical Damage**. [00:00:34]
- **Armor:** High **Flat Armor/ES/Evasion**. [00:04:24]
- **Wands:** High **% Physical Spell Damage**. [00:06:03]

### Step 2: The Essence Upgrade
Use a **Greater Essence** to upgrade the item to Rare while adding a second mandatory stat.
- **Physical Weapons:** **Essence of Abrasion** for flat physical. [00:01:07]
- **Armor:** **Essence of Enhancement** for 80% increased defenses. [00:04:33]
- **Wands:** **Essence of [Element/Spell]** for % increased spell damage. [00:06:10]

### Step 3: Desecrate and Slam
- Use a **Preserved Jawbone** (weapons) or **Preserved Rib** (armor) to add a **Desecrated Modifier**. [00:01:35]
- **Force a Prefix:** Use an **Omen of Sinistral Necromancy** if you need more damage (like extra fire/lightning). [00:01:42]
- Fill the remaining slots with **Exalted Orbs**. [00:02:42]

## Finisher: Skill Levels
For weapons, finish the craft with a **Perfect Essence of Battle** (Attack) or **Sorcery** (Spells) to add **+5 Level of Skill Gems**. This will replace one random suffix, so use it when you have a "junk" suffix to lose. [00:02:48]

> 💡 **Pro tip:** If you are low on budget, don't use **Omen of Abyssal Echoes**. The standard **Well of Souls** choice of 3 is often enough to find a usable resistance or damage roll, saving you a significant amount of currency. [00:02:11]
