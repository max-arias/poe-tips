## Overview

In Path of Exile 2, Energy Shield (ES) body armours are highly sought after, especially those that roll **Spirit** and high **Resistances**. This method utilizes **Essences**, **Omens**, and the **Well of Souls** to create high-value items reliably.

## Phase 1: Base Selection

Choosing the right base is critical for the final Energy Shield values. [00:01:05]

- **Base Stats:** Look for bases with high **Flat Maximum Energy Shield**.
- **Item Level:** Aim for **iLvl 82** for the best tier potential, though **iLvl 78** is a functional minimum. [00:05:14]
- **Starting Suffixes:** Ideally, find a base that already has T1 or T2 **Resistances**.

## Phase 2: The Crafting Process

### 1. The Prefix Foundation
Use a **Greater Essence of Enchantment** on your magic base. This adds a significant **% Increased Energy Shield** modifier. [00:01:49]

### 2. Filling Suffixes (Resistances)
To fill your suffix slots with Resistances, use an **Omen of Dexterous Exaltation**. This ensures that when you use **Exalted Orbs**, you only roll **Suffix** modifiers. [00:02:46]
- Target: High **Cold**, **Fire**, or **Lightning** resistances.

### 3. The Final Prefix (Spirit or Hybrid ES)
Once your suffixes are set, use the **Well of Souls** to hit a high-value third prefix. [00:04:33]
- **Preparation:** Use a **Preserved Grip** to protect the item and an **Omen of Abyssal Echo** to allow you to roll twice in the Well of Souls. [00:04:48]
- **Priority Stat:** Look for **Spirit**. Many meta builds (like Druids) require Spirit on the body armour to function, making this the most profitable hit. [00:04:12]
- **Alternative Stat:** High **Hybrid Energy Shield** is a solid secondary outcome.

## Phase 3: Finishing Touches

- **Quality:** Use **Armourer's Scraps** (or equivalent) to reach 20% quality, which directly increases the base Energy Shield. [00:06:26]
- **Sockets:** Ensure the item has the maximum number of sockets. [00:06:48]
- **Runes:** Apply **Iron Runes** to further boost the item's stats. [00:07:00]

> 💡 **Pro tip:** If you are profit crafting, always aim for **Spirit** in the final step. Even if you miss the triple resistance roll, a high ES chest with Spirit is significantly easier to sell than one without it. [00:08:59]
