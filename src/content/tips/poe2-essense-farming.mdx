## Strategy Overview

Essence farming is one of the most reliable ways to build wealth in **Path of Exile 2**. By stacking **Precursor Tablets** that guarantee essence spawns and using **Vaal Orbs** to manipulate the outcomes, you can consistently generate high-value crafting materials.

## Requirements

* **Tier 15 Maps**: Allie recommends "Wastes" as a preferred layout.
* **Precursor Tablets**: Use **Overseer Precursor Tablets** with "Guaranteed additional Essences" (ideally 2 per map).
* **Atlas Tree**: Focus on all Essence nodes and Precursor Tablet nodes.
* **Vaal Orbs**: Essential for upgrading essences on the monster before you release them.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Map Preparation**: Alch your Tier 15 maps to 4-mods. If your build is strong, use **Exalted Orbs** to reach 6-mods to enable three tablet slots.
2.  **Apply Tablets**: Use two "2-essence" tablets and one "1-essence" tablet (or another mechanic like Abyss/Breach).
3.  **The Boss Rush**: Run straight to the map boss and kill them first. This lights up all remaining mechanics (Essences) on the minimap, saving you from clearing every corner.
4.  **The Vaal Rule**: Check the essence monster before opening:
    * **DON'T Vaal** if it has: **Perfect Sorcery, Haste, or Battle**; or **Greater Ruin or Opulence**. These are already high-value. Just kill it.
    * **DO Vaal** if it doesn't have the above. This can upgrade Greater to Perfect, or Perfect into **Corrupted Essences** (Hysteria, Insanity, etc.) worth ~1 Divine each.

## Atlas Passives & Customization

* **Energetic Resonance**: Select this node for more Attack Speed and Chaos modifiers (currently the highest value).
* **Crystal Realm**: Ensure you have the 3 points in the boss tree to get an extra essence from the map boss.
* **Remnants of Power**: Provides a 20% chance to double the total essences in your maps.

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Check your 6-mod maps for high **Item Rarity** (60%+). These maps are worth 10-30+ Exalted Orbs to high-end runners. It is often more profitable to sell these "lucky rolls" and buy fresh maps than to run them yourself.

## Selling Your Loot

Use the **Currency Exchange** for fast sales. Focus on high-volume essences (check PoE.Ninja). Note that some essences have zero trade volume—don't waste time trying to sell "junk" essences; focus on the high-value ones like **Battle**, **Haste**, and **Sorcery**.
