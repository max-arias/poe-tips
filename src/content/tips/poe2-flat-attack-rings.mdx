## Overview

In **Path of Exile 2**, rings and amulets are the primary sources of **Item Rarity**. This method combines deterministic **Essences** with **Catalyzing Exalts** to secure high-tier damage and utility stats.

## Step-by-Step Crafting

### 1. The Magic Base
Start with a magic ring that has a high-tier (T1 or T2) **Elemental Flat Attack** roll. This is your "lever" for the rest of the craft. [00:00:52]

### 2. Guaranteed Rarity
Use an **Opulence Essence** on your magic base. Since the rarity nerfs, this essence now guarantees **Tier 1 Rarity**. This sets a strong foundation of two high-tier mods. [00:01:30]

### 3. Fixing Suffixes (Resistances/Attributes)
- Apply **Resistance** or **Attribute Catalysts** to your ring.
- Use an **Omen of Dextral Exaltation** (targets suffixes) combined with an **Omen of Catalyzing Exaltation** (boosts catalyzed mod weight). [00:03:33]
- Slam a **Perfect Exalted Orb** to target a high tier of the desired suffix.

### 4. The Physical Prefix
- Apply **Physical Catalysts** to the ring.
- Since suffixes are now full, use a **Perfect Exalted Orb**. [00:07:02]
- **Physical damage** has a higher weight than elemental on rings, making this step relatively consistent for hitting a second flat damage type. [00:05:47]

### 5. The Finisher: Desecrated Mods
Use an **Ancient Collarbone** or a **Preserved Collarbone** (with an **Omen of Abyssal Echoes**) to add a desecrated modifier. [00:09:07]
- **Target Stats:** Look for a third **Flat Damage** roll, **Maximum Life**, or additional **Rarity**.
- A successful hit here can result in a "Triple Flat" ring with over 45% total rarity. [00:11:07]

> 💡 **Pro tip:** If you "brick" the final prefix (e.g., hit fire damage instead of physical), use a **Sinistral Crystallization** combined with an **Essence of the Abyss** for a 50/50 chance to remove the bad prefix and try again. [00:07:59]
