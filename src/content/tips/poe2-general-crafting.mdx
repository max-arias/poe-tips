## The Core Essentials

If you plan on crafting endgame gear, these items are non-negotiable for the "Foundation and Manipulation" phases[cite: 3, 80, 157].

- **Greater Essences:** Used to turn magic bases into rare items with a guaranteed second Tier 1 stat[cite: 8, 82, 160].
  - *Priority:* **Abrasion** (Physical), **Enchantment/Enhancement** (Defenses), and **Sorcery** (Spells)[cite: 8, 79, 165].
- **Exalted Orbs & Greater Exalted Orbs:** Standard Exalts add suffixes for crystallization bait, while Greater Exalts ensure you skip low-tier (T4-T5) rolls[cite: 10, 87, 150].
- **Omens of Dextral Crystallization:** The single most important tool for deterministically swapping junk suffixes for build-defining mods like **+5 Skill Levels** or **Onslaught**[cite: 77, 88, 90].

## The "Well of Souls" Kit

These items are required for the final "Finisher" phase to safely add a 6th Tier 1 modifier[cite: 12, 127, 163].

- **Preservation Items:** Used to protect the item and access the Well of Souls[cite: 12, 127, 163].
  - **Preserved Jawbone:** For Weapons[cite: 67, 127].
  - **Preserved Grip/Rib:** For Body Armour and Boots[cite: 12, 31, 32].
  - **Ancient/Preserved Collarbone:** For Rings and Amulets[cite: 109].
- **Abyssal Echoes Omen:** Highly recommended for every high-end craft; it doubles your choices in the Well of Souls[cite: 12, 133].
- **Necromancy Omens:**
  - **Dextral Necromancy:** Forces the Well of Souls to offer only **Suffixes**[cite: 73, 128].
  - **Sinistral Necromancy:** Forces the Well of Souls to offer only **Prefixes**[cite: 129, 164].

## Strategy-Specific Tools

Stockpile these based on the specific type of item you are crafting[cite: 135, 103, 23].

| Item Type | Essential Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Minion Scepters** | **Homogenizing Omen** | Forces the **Minion** tag for guaranteed +4 levels[cite: 135, 140, 149]. |
| **High-End Boots** | **Fracturing Orb** | Locks in T1 Movement Speed or Life before Essence spamming[cite: 23, 27]. |
| **Rarity Jewelry** | **Catalyzing Omen** | Boosts the weight of catalyzed stats (Resists/Attributes) during an Exalt slam[cite: 97, 104]. |
| **Physical Weapons** | **Iron Runes** | Essential final step to scale base Physical damage[cite: 17, 93]. |

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Always keep a stack of **Annulling Orbs** and **Perfect Augmentations**[cite: 35, 121]. These are vital for isolating specific Tier 1 mods on a white or magic base before you begin the expensive Rare-tier crafting steps[cite: 35, 120].
