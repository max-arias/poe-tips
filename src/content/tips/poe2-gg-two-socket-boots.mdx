## Overview

Crafting high-tier boots in PoE 2 requires at least two sockets. The "GG" method relies on **Fracturing Orbs** to lock in a critical stat before using expensive essences for movement speed and socket effects.

## The Fracturing Strategy

### For Life Builds
Target a **Fractured Suffix** (e.g., Armor applies to Elemental Resistance) or **Fractured T1 Life**. This allows you to work on the other side of the item safely. [00:06:22]

### For Energy Shield Builds
Target a **Fractured T1 ES Prefix** (Flat or Percent) on a **Sama Sandals** base. [00:06:01]

## Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. Movement Speed
Use an **Essence of Hysteria** to guarantee **30% Movement Speed**. 
- **Safety:** Use an **Omen of Dextral Crystallization** to ensure this essence only removes a suffix, protecting your fractured or high-tier prefixes. [00:07:59]

### 2. Socketed Effect
Use an **Essence of Horror** to add **Socketed Buffs have % increased Effect**. 
- If your suffixes are full, you can cycle **Horrors** and **Preserved Ribs** (Desecration) to replace unwanted stats until you have the perfect suffix set. [00:05:27]

### 3. The Unveil (The Echo)
Finish the item with a **Preserved Rib** and an **Omen of Abyssal Echoes**. [00:10:34]
- **Target:** Look for **Hybrid Chaos Resistance**, **Attributes**, or **Hybrid Elemental Resistances**.
- **Lich Builds:** Hybrid Resistance/Chaos rolls are particularly valuable for popular Lich-based Energy Shield builds. [00:11:40]

> 💡 **Pro tip:** When chaos spamming for a second T1 ES mod after fracturing the first, if the base doesn't have two sockets, you can use **Annulling Orbs** and **Augments** on a white base to isolate the mod before fracturing. [00:07:20]
