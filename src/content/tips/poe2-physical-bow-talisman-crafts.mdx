## Overview

This guide explains how to craft a "perfect" physical weapon (Bow or Talisman) by using **Omens of Crystallization** to force-remove bad stats and replace them with guaranteed high-tier modifiers.

## The Crafting Sequence

### 1. The Base
Find a **Magi Talisman** or **Obliterator Bow** (high crit/phys bases) with at least **150% Increased Physical Damage** and one "junk" suffix. [00:01:05]

### 2. Adding Flat Physical
Use a **Greater Essence of Abrasion** to add **Flat Physical Damage**. [00:05:06]

### 3. Prefix Completion
- Use an **Omen of Dextral Crystallization**.
- Apply a **Perfect Essence of Abrasion**. This removes the junk suffix and adds **% of Damage as Extra Physical Damage**, locking in 3 perfect prefixes. [00:06:16]

### 4. Suffix Setup & Desecration
- Use **Greater Exalted Orbs** (with an **Omen of Greater Exaltation**) to fill the suffix slots. [00:07:12]
- Use an **Omen of Lege** and a **Preserved Jawbone** to add a **Desecrated Modifier**. 
- In the **Well of Souls**, choose **Attack Speed** (Amanamu tag). [00:07:45]

### 5. The "Suffix Cleanse"
Now that the item is full, use the following to replace the bad suffixes:
- **Perfect Essence of Haste:** Guarantees **Onslaught**. [00:09:30]
- **Perfect Essence of Battle:** Guarantees **+5 to all Attack Skill Gems**. [00:08:54]
- These essences will remove a suffix, protecting your perfect prefixes. If they remove your Attack Speed, simply re-apply the Desecration step using a **Dextral Necromancy Omen** to target suffixes only. [00:10:07]

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Always use an **Omen of Dextral Necromancy** when re-adding a desecrated mod if your prefixes are already perfect. This prevents the Well of Souls from potentially offering a prefix that would overwrite your physical damage. [00:10:07]
