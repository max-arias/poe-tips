## Overview

Crafting an endgame staff in Path of Exile 2 involves a "free-flow" approach that prioritizes **Cast Speed**, **+X to Spell Levels**, and **Gain as Extra Damage**. This method works for almost any spellcaster build, including Spark and Cast on Crit. [00:00:12]

## Preparation

- **Base Selection:** Use a loot filter to identify white bases. For **+7 levels**, you need an **iLvl 81** base. **iLvl 80** bases can still hit **+6 levels**. [00:01:11]
- **Targeting Elements:** - **Lightning:** Use Voltaic or Paralyzing bases.
    - **Ice:** Use Gelled or Icicle bases.
    - **Generic:** Roaring bases can roll any plus level. [00:02:15]

## Step-by-Step Crafting

### 1. The Magic Foundation
- Start with a **Perfect Orb of Transmutation** to hit a high-tier prefix (like Spell Damage or Gain as Extra). [00:02:58]
- Follow up with a **Perfect Orb of Augmentation** to fish for a second strong modifier. [00:03:13]

### 2. Transitioning to Rare
Instead of using a Regal Orb, use a **Greater Essence** to guarantee a specific suffix:
- **Essence of Seeking:** For guaranteed **Critical Strike Chance**. [00:03:28]
- **Essence for Cast Speed:** Highly recommended for almost every build over crit. [00:04:39]

### 3. Forcing Spell Levels
If you don't hit plus levels naturally, use a **Perfect Essence of Sorcery** to guarantee **+5 to All Spell Skill Gems**. [00:04:07]
> 💡 **Pro tip:** This Essence removes a random modifier if the suffixes are full. To ensure success, try to have a "garbage" suffix (like low Mana Regen) that you don't mind losing. [00:12:18]

### 4. Finishing with the Well of Souls
Once you have 5 modifiers, use a **Preserve Jawbone** to add a final crafted modifier from the Well of Souls. [00:08:12]
- **Omen of Dextral Necromancy:** Use before the Jawbone to force the Well to offer **Suffix** options (like Cast Speed). [00:08:44]
- **Omen of Sinistral Necromancy:** Use to force the Well to offer **Prefix** options (like Gain as Extra). [00:08:52]

## Key Modifiers to Prioritize

- **Gain Damage as Extra [Element]:** Often the strongest prefix as it acts as a "more" damage multiplier. [00:05:56]
- **Cast Speed:** The most important suffix for fluid gameplay and DPS. [00:04:31]
- **Spell Damage:** High-tier rolls (T1) are competitive with "Gain as Extra" mods. [00:06:17]

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Use an **Omen of Abyssal Echoes** before using the Jawbone to roll twice in the Well of Souls, giving you a much higher chance to hit a T1 modifier. [00:13:54]
