## Overview

This craft takes advantage of recombinator rules to reliably transfer the +1 Spectre mod onto a high ES base while keeping T1 ES rolls.

## Materials Needed

- +1 Spectre chest on non-ES base
- Several ilvl 86 Twilight Regalias
- Orbs of Alteration (~500)
- Recombinators
- Tailoring Orb
- Sacred Orbs

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Buy the +1 Spectre Base

Find a chest with **+1 to Maximum Number of Raised Spectres** that:
- Is NOT on a pure ES base
- Has exactly 2 prefixes (any combination of hybrid life/defense, %defense, flat defense)

### Step 2: Prepare Twilight Regalias

1. Buy several ilvl 86 Twilight Regalias
2. Alt spam for T1 flat ES or T1% ES
3. Use regex `"resp|unfa"` in stash to highlight hits

### Step 3: Combine ES Mods

Recombine flat ES + %ES twilights together:
- Goal: Twilight with both T1 flat ES and T1% ES with an open prefix

### Step 4: The Main Recombine

Combine your T1/T1 ES Twilight with the +1 Spectre chest.

**The math:**
- 5 total prefixes = 50/50 to keep 2 or 3 mods
- If it picks Twilight (50%) AND 3 mods (50%) = guaranteed +1 Spectre + T1% + T1 flat
- **25% success rate** per attempt

### Step 5: Finishing Touches

1. Use Tailoring Orb for 8% increased defenses implicit
2. Sacred Orb until you hit 1000+ ES
3. Use Eldritch currency for good suffixes (int, resistances)
4. Bench craft as needed

## Risk Management

- Failed recombinations often leave you with usable items (T1/T1 ES bases or raw +1 Spectre)
- Don't overinvest in a single attempt


> ⚠️ **Note:** This requires recombinators, which are not available in every league. Check if your current league has access to this crafting method.
