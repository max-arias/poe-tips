## Overview

This craft takes advantage of recombinator rules to reliably transfer the +1 Spectre mod onto a high ES base while keeping T1 ES rolls.

**Expected outcome:** 35 div average sell price, 10 div average cost = **25 div profit**

## Materials Needed

- +1 Spectre chest on non-ES base (1-2 div)
- Several ilvl 86 Twilight Regalias (5c each)
- Orbs of Alteration (~500)
- Recombinators
- Tailoring Orb
- Sacred Orbs

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Buy the +1 Spectre Base

Find a chest with **+1 to Maximum Number of Raised Spectres** that:
- Is NOT on a pure ES base
- Has exactly 2 prefixes (any combination of hybrid life/defense, %defense, flat defense)

[Trade link example](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade/search/Settlers)

**Budget:** Maximum 1 divine

### Step 2: Prepare Twilight Regalias

1. Buy several ilvl 86 Twilight Regalias for 5c each
2. Alt spam for T1 flat ES or T1% ES
3. Use regex `"resp|unfa"` in stash to highlight hits

### Step 3: Combine ES Mods

Recombine flat ES + %ES twilights together:
- Goal: Twilight with both T1 flat ES and T1% ES with an open prefix

### Step 4: The Main Recombine

Combine your T1/T1 ES Twilight with the +1 Spectre chest.

**The math:**
- 5 total prefixes = 50/50 to keep 2 or 3 mods
- If it picks Twilight (50%) AND 3 mods (50%) = guaranteed +1 Spectre + T1% + T1 flat
- **25% success rate** per attempt

### Step 5: Finishing Touches

1. Use Tailoring Orb for 8% increased defenses implicit
2. Sacred Orb until you hit 1000+ ES
3. Use Eldritch currency for good suffixes (int, resistances)
4. Bench craft as needed

## Profit Breakdown

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| +1 Spectre chest | 1 div |
| Twilight bases (5-10) | 0.5 div |
| Alterations | 0.5 div |
| Recombinators | 7 div |
| Finishing currency | 1 div |
| **Total Average** | **~10 div** |

| Outcome | Sell Price |
|---------|-----------|
| 1000 ES + good suffixes | 35-70 div |
| 900 ES mediocre suffixes | 15-20 div |
| Failed (recovery) | 2-5 div |

## Risk Management

- Failed recombines often leave you with sellable items (T1/T1 ES bases or raw +1 Spectre)
- Don't overinvest in a single attempt
- Check current Spectre chest prices before starting

> ⚠️ **Note:** This requires recombinators, which are not available in every league. Check if your current league has access to this crafting method.
