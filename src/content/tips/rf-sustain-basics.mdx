## Understanding RF Degen

Righteous Fire deals **90% of your maximum life as fire damage per second** to yourself. To sustain it, your life regeneration must exceed this degen.

## Key Regeneration Sources

### From the Passive Tree
- **Purity of Flesh** cluster - up to 1.6% life regen
- **Constitution** area - 1% life regen
- **Devotion** nodes near Templar - strength + life regen

### From Ascendancies
- **Chieftain** - "Hinekora, Death's Fury" for fire damage leech converted to regen
- **Juggernaut** - "Unflinching" and "Unbreakable" for massive regen
- **Guardian** - "Radiant Crusade" for 1% base regen

### From Gear
- **Elder helmets/shields** with "% life regenerated per second"
- **Watcher's Eye** with Vitality mods
- **Stone Golem** for flat life regen

## Reducing the Degen

It's not just about out-regenerating - you can also reduce how much damage you take:

1. **Maximum Fire Resistance** - Every point above 75% reduces the burn by ~4%
   - Purity of Fire + aura effect
   - Rise of the Phoenix shield
   - Melding of the Flesh (advanced)

2. **"Less damage taken"** modifiers work on self-damage

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting fire resistance while leveling
- Not having enough regen for RF + other degen sources (Blood Rage)
- Turning on RF before you have the gear to sustain it

## Breakpoints

| Max Fire Res | Effective Degen | Regen Needed |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| 75%         | 22.5%          | ~23%         |
| 80%         | 18%            | ~18%         |
| 85%         | 13.5%          | ~14%         |
| 90%         | 9%             | ~9%          |
