## How It Works

Any NPC vendor in Path of Exile will accept 3 scarabs of the same tier and give you back 1 random scarab of that same tier.

## Step by Step

1. Collect scarabs you don't use (e.g., Bestiary, Torment, etc.)
2. Make sure they're all the same tier (Rusted, Polished, Gilded, or Winged)
3. Sell exactly 3 to any vendor
4. Receive 1 random scarab of that tier

## Tips

- **Don't vendor valuable scarabs!** Check prices on [poe.ninja](https://poe.ninja) first
- This is especially useful for:
  - Converting league mechanic scarabs you don't run
  - Getting rid of low-demand scarabs like Bestiary or Torment
- Winged scarab conversion can be particularly profitable since the variance is high

## When to Use This

- Early league when you're accumulating many low-value scarabs
- When certain league mechanics are unpopular and their scarabs are worthless
- To consolidate inventory space

> **Pro tip:** Set up a dump tab filter to highlight low-value scarabs so you remember to vendor them in batches of 3.
