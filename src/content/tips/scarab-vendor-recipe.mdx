## How It Works

Any NPC vendor in Path of Exile will accept 3 scarabs of the same tier and give you back 1 random scarab of that same tier.

## Step by Step

1. Bulk sell cheap scarabs to any vendor in sets of 3
2. Receive 1 random scarab of that tier
3. Repeat!

## Tips

- **Use regex to find cheap scarabs:** Go to [poe.re/scarab](https://poe.re/#/scarab) and use the **"Auto select cheap scarabs"** button. This generates a regex to highlight only low-value scarabs in your stash, making it easy to see which ones to vendor.
