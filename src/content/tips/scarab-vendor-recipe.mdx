## How It Works

Any NPC vendor in Path of Exile will accept 3 scarabs of the same tier and give you back 1 random scarab of that same tier.

## Step by Step

1. Collect scarabs you don't use (e.g., Bestiary, Torment, etc.)
2. Make sure they're all the same tier (Rusted, Polished, Gilded, or Winged)
3. Sell exactly 3 to any vendor
4. Receive 1 random scarab of that tier

## Tips

- **Use regex to find cheap scarabs:** Go to [poe.re/scarab](https://poe.re/#/scarab) and use the **"Auto select cheap scarabs"** button. This generates a regex to highlight only low-value scarabs in your stash, making it easy to see which ones to vendor.


## When to Use This

- Early league when you're accumulating many low-demand scarabs
- When certain league mechanics are unpopular

- To consolidate inventory space

> **Pro tip:** Set up a dump tab filter to highlight low-value scarabs so you remember to vendor them in batches of 3.
